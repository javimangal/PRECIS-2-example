This repository contains an example of the comparison of two hypothetical trials in aging research, one of which is explanatory and the second of which is pragmatic in nature. This figure was used in the associated review article *[Statistical Considerations for the Design and Analysis of Pragmatic Trialsin Aging Research](https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202405.0385/v1)*.

# Usage

The code in the [PRECIS-2.R script](/PRECIS-2.R) generates a comparative PRECIS-2 figure of two hypothetical trials. The scoring of PRECIS-2 elements for the two hypothetical trials was done according to the documentation in the [PRECIS-2 website](https://www.precis-2.org/Help/Documentation/Help). You can find an explanation of our rationale for the scoring of these two hypothetical trials in the [Rationale_hypothetical_trials document](/Rationale_hypothetical_trials.docx).
